# ev3-menu
A simple menu pseudo-API for LeJOS on the EV3  
Created during my first semester at NTNU

...take it as a case study of what happens when somebody who has yet to be taught about polymorpism tries to make a class that can be tied to one of two possible types of actions (loading another menu vs. calling a method).
